* The English will receive $12,000 per child and French receive $20,000. 

### 3. Safe drinking water
* Reports of 400 out of 618 reserves have struggled with unsafe drinking water in a 10 year span.

### 4. Federal Law review
* Court systems continuously ignored land rights and treaties.

* They have a personal stake in seeing our economy grow instead of dealing with litigation.

### 5. Close the Gap
* NATO reports Canada listed 6th in standard of living in the world. Our aboriginal communities ranked 63rd.
